Please find the following files included, in addition to this README:

project2.h
project2.c
Makefile
query.txt       # set of test queries. 
config.txt      # configuration we used during one set of testing.
config2.txt     # config for a second set of tests.
output.txt      # output based on run with query.txt and config.txt
output2.txt     # output based on run with query.txt and config2.txt
stage2.sh



TO RUN OUR CODE:

from the command line, run:

'./stage2.sh <query_file> <config_file>'

where <query_file> is query.txt, unless you supply your own query file,
and <config_file> is either config.txt or config2.txt, unless you supply
your own config file.

stage2.sh will check if 'make' has been typed, and builds the executable
'selconds' if it has not yet been built.  If you wish to type 'make'
before running the stage2.sh command, that will work, too.



ASSUMPTIONS:
- the query files and config files are formatted exactly as in the project
  assignment.  We do not handle poorly- or ill-formed query or config
  files, and running with a bad query or config file will cause
  indeterminate results (though testing indicates segfaults, so please use
  good files)

- a query file contains no more than 1000 queries (lines).  To make memory
  management easier, we statically allocate 1000-query max, based on the
  value of MAX_RUNS defined in project.h.

- a query contains no more than 15 filters.  We statically allocate a
  maximum of 15 filters in project.h to make memory management
  considerably easier.  We have tested our optimizer with as many as 9
  filters, though it should work with up to 15.



THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED:

- Time complexity appears to be correct; using a test that printed a line
  for every iteration of part 2 of the algorithm, we found O(4^n) to be an
  excellent estimation of the time complexity (~number of lines our test
  printed).

- Tested sample_query.txt as input, it produced output nearly identical to
  sample_output.txt All costs are correct; only difference is a redundant
  pair of parens on the last &-term in the if-statement.


TODO: test with a very high no-branch cost -> increase a greatly.
      my_config.txt does this, and the output isn't printed very well.
      --> this looks like an issue with the last leaf not being chosen as
          a no-branch.  We just need to move where we print out those
          extra parens.
